This dataset contains 36,275 hotel booking records with various attributes related to guests, booking details, and cancellation status. Key columns include the number of adults and children, nights stayed (both weekdays and weekends), meal plan, room type, lead time, and car parking spaces reserved. It also provides information about the booking source (e.g., online or offline), whether the guest is a repeated customer, and the average room price. In addition to these core details, the dataset offers insights into customer preferences, such as special requests and meal plan choices, as well as patterns related to repeated guests. The inclusion of lead time data allows for analysis of how early bookings affect cancellations, while room type and market segment data help understand demand across different customer groups. With comprehensive data on both successful and canceled bookings, this dataset is ideal for analyzing booking patterns, predicting cancellations, optimizing pricing strategies, and improving customer service and marketing efforts in the hospitality industry.
